# Hi, I'm Omer Dedo 👋

I'm a graduate in **Information Technology Expertise** from **Epitech Benin**, with a strong focus on **cybersecurity** and a growing interest in **artificial intelligence**, especially where it meets security, automation, and real-world problem solving.

I spend most of my time learning, testing, breaking things (ethically), and understanding how systems actually work — not just how they’re supposed to work.

---

## 🔐 What I focus on

Cybersecurity is my main field.  
It’s complex, demanding, and sometimes overwhelming — which is exactly why I chose it.

I work across both **defensive and offensive security**, including:

- Network and system security  
- Vulnerability management and remediation  
- Penetration testing and ethical hacking  
- Web application security  
- Malware analysis (introductory level)  
- Security policies and risk management (PSSI mindset)

Along the way, I realized that **AI is becoming unavoidable**, including in cybersecurity.  
So I actively explore **generative AI**, not as a trend, but as a tool to work smarter.

## 🧠 Artificial Intelligence & Automation

I experiment with AI tools for:

- Task automation and workflow optimization  
- Web development assistance  
- Video and music generation  
- Design and presentation creation  
- Prompt engineering and intelligent agents  

My goal is simple:  
**combine cybersecurity skills with AI to build efficient, scalable, and secure solutions.**

## 🤝 How I work

- Curious and self-driven  
- Comfortable working in teams  
- Disciplined with time and learning  
- Always trying to *understand deeply*, not just pass courses  

I value consistency more than speed. Progress compounds.

## 🎯 Goals

My long-term goal is to become a **high-level cybersecurity expert**, capable of securing complex digital infrastructures while leveraging **AI and automation** to improve efficiency and resilience.

Still learning. Still building. Still pushing.
